## üì¶ Submodules

### [dnsproxy/](./dnsproxy)
Enhanced Go-based DNS proxy server with **Merkle tree batching and verification system**:
- Batches DNS responses for efficient cryptographic verification 
- Embeds Merkle proofs and ECDSA/RSA signatures in DNS TXT records
- Provides end-to-end response integrity verification with minimal performance overhead
- **Repository**: https://github.com/noamsdahan/dnsproxy

### [dns-lab-aws/](./dns-lab-aws) 
Terraform infrastructure for comprehensive DNS testing and performance evaluation:
- KNOT DNS authoritative servers with online DNSSEC signing
- BIND recursive resolver with Merkle verification overlay
- Automated performance testing across 24+ configurations
- Cost-optimized deployment options (~$0.13/hour for testing)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Clone with Submodules
```bash
git clone --recursive <your-repo-url>
cd unified-dns-research

# If already cloned, initialize submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build and Test Locally
```bash
# Build the enhanced DNS proxy
cd dnsproxy
make build

# Run with Merkle verification enabled
./dnsproxy --listen 127.0.0.1:5353 --upstream 8.8.8.8:53 --merkle-ans --batch-size 4 -v

# Test in another terminal
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5353 example.com
```

### Deploy AWS Test Infrastructure
```bash
# Deploy cost-effective test environment
cd dns-lab-aws/terraform/ec2
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="functional-test.tfvars"
```

## üìä Research Results

### Performance Highlights
- **Peak Performance**: 15,536 QPS (RSA, batch size 1024)
- **CPU Efficiency**: 48% reduction in overhead (229% ‚Üí 119%)
- **Algorithm Comparison**: ECDSA 39% faster at small batch sizes
- **Optimal Batch Range**: 256-1024 responses for production deployment

### Key Findings
| Configuration | QPS | CPU Overhead | Performance Gain |
|---------------|-----|--------------|------------------|
| ECDSA Batch 1 | 13,038 | 229% | Baseline |
| ECDSA Batch 1024 | 14,100 | 119% | +8.1% |
| RSA Batch 1 | 9,378 | 267% | Baseline |
| RSA Batch 1024 | 15,536 | 134% | +65.7% |

## üî¨ Research Contributions

## üîí Security Considerations

- All sensitive files (SSH keys, AWS credentials) are properly gitignored
- Cryptographic keys are generated locally and never committed
- Infrastructure configurations use secure defaults
- Regular security audits ensure no credential exposure

## ü§ù Contributing

This research project welcomes contributions in:
- Performance optimization and algorithm improvements
- Additional cryptographic signature schemes
- Infrastructure enhancements and cost optimizations
- Documentation improvements and clarity
